# react-native-chat

The idea is to build a chat ios app with backend using js.

The chat app use react native, currently only works for ios.

The backend is https://github.com/z-hao-wang/chatServer

Due to adding RSA encryption methods, I am moving over this project into a private repo.

The existing state provides basic function for realtime messaging and push notif feature.

This app use websocket to transmit all network requests.
